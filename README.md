## prog1.py
***
The prog1.py file guides on how to make a deep learning model using Tensorflow, and Keras. The dataset used is a collection of images of handwritten digits 0-9, of the same dimension 28 x 28.

The number_reader.model is generated when the python code is run. So, in order to use this program, after cloning the repo, delete the model directory.
