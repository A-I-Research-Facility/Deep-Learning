# DeepLearning

General take on deep learning using python language with Tensorflow, and Keras.

***
Requirements :  
   1) Python3  
   2) numpy  
   3) Tensorflow  
   4) Keras  
   5) matplotlib
   6) opencv-python
***

**prog1.py**
------------
The prog1.py file guides on how to make a deep learning model using Tensorflow, and Keras. The dataset used is a collection of images of handwritten digits 0-9, of the same dimension 28 x 28.

The number_reader.model is generated when the python code is run. So, in order to use this program, after cloning the repo, delete the model directory. 

-------------
The guide is super easy to follow, but if you have any questions, please email them to cserveairf@gmail.com or create pull requests regarding your questions.

Enjoy!!!
