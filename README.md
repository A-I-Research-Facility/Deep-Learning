## prog1
The prog1.py file guides on how to make a deep learning model using Tensorflow, and Keras. The dataset used is a collection of images of handwritten digits 0-9, of the same dimension 28 x 28.

The number_reader.model is generated when the python code is run. So, in order to use this program, after cloning the repo, delete the model directory.

## prog2
This program demonstrates how we can create and load our own data. It covers taking a dataset, in this case it is a collection of images of cats and dogs  
   available here => https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765  

In this program we learn to classify the data, reshape necessary objects, extract the required features, and create the raw training dataset.  
   After that we shuffle the data, and finally save it with its features and labels separated for future use.
